# EMGfromLFP

Derive EMG from LFP through correlation of highfrequency activity.

This code is basically a Python translation and readaptation of the
bz_EMGFromLFP.m function from Buzsaki's lab.
(`https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode/blob/master/detectors/bz_EMGFromLFP.m`).
Based on Erik Schomburg's and code and work, published in `Theta Phase
Segregation of Input-Specific Gamma Patterns in Entorhinal-Hippocampal Networks,
Schomburg et al., Neuron 2014.``

## Installation

- Download and install the `sleepscore` (<https://github.com/CSC-UW/sleepscore>)

```
# From the `sleepscore` directory you just downloaded
pip install -e .
```

- Install this package `EMGfromLFP` (<https://github.com/CSC-UW/EMGfromLFP>)

```
# From the `EMGfromLFP` directory you just downloaded
pip install -e .
```

## Usage:


1.  Copy the default configuration file (`EMG_config_df`)

2.  Manually set the parameters for the copied config file. 


- From the command line (make sure you're in your virtualenvironment)
  
`python -m EMGfromLFP <path_to_config_file>`

- From python:

```python
import EMGfromLFP

EMGfromLFP.run(<path_to_config_file>)
```

3. Load the computed data with

```python
import EMGfromLFP

# Load
EMGfromLFP.load_EMG(
  <path_to_EMGdata>, tStart=None, tEnd=None, desired_length=None
)
```
